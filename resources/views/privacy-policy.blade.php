        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Information Collection and Use</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">Information Collection</p>
        <p>ADK-Today is the sole owner of the information collected on www.ADK-Today and its other registered domain names. ADK-Today collects information from our users at several different points on our website.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Information Use</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Profile</p>
        
        <p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our website, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. Your profile is shared in aggregate form only together with your personally identifiable information.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Cookies</p>
        
        <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>
        
        <p>By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" section.</p>
        
        <p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Log Files</p>
        
        <p>Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Communications from the Site</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Special Offers and Updates</p>
        
        <p>We may send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, and special deals. </p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Service Announcements</p>
        
        <p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Customer Service</p>
        
        <p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Sharing</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Legal Disclaimer</p>
        
        <p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</p>
        
        <p>We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Third Party Advertisers</p>
        
        <p>ADK-Today may share website usage information about users with a reputable third party for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site and other sites. For example, ADK-Today uses cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which allow them to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The information they collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable.</p>
        
        <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when users visit our site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on our site, other websites and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, check out https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.</p>
        
        <p>These are the instances in which we will share users' personal information:</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Service Providers</p>
        
        <p>We may partner with other third parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Links</p>
        
        <p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, ADK-Today, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Surveys [& Contests]</p>
        
        <p>From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Survey information generally will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold">Notification of Changes</p>
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement.</p>
